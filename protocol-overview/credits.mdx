Users can purchase API credits with crypto. These credits are used to access Heurist's decentralized AI compute resources, with different API endpoints consuming credits based on their computational requirements.

* 1 USD = 100 credits
* When paying with HEU tokens, users receive a 20% bonus (120 credits per $1 equivalent)
