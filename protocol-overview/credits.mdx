Users can purchase API credits with crypto. These credits are used to access Heurist's decentralized AI compute resources, with different API endpoints consuming credits based on their computational requirements.

* 1 USD = 100 credits
* When paying with HEU tokens, users receive a 20% bonus (120 credits per $1 equivalent)

Credits can be purchased at [heurist.ai/credits](https://heurist.ai/credits). 

### Credits Consumption

#### 1. Image Generation
Base pricing is calculated for 1024x1024 resolution with 20 iterations. Other resolutions or iteration counts are priced proportionally.

| Model | Credits per Image |
|-------|------------------|
| Stable Diffusion XL/1.5 | 0.05 |
| Stable Diffusion with LoRA | 0.1 |
| FLUX.1-dev | 0.2 |
| FLUX.1-dev with LoRA | 0.5 |

#### 2. Video Generation
| Model | Duration | Credits |
|-------|----------|----------|
| Hunyuan | 5 seconds | 25 |

#### 3. Large Language Models
Pricing is in credits per million tokens. Each model has separate pricing for input tokens (what you send as prompts) and output tokens (what the model generates).

| Model | Input (per 1M tokens) | Output (per 1M tokens) |
|-------|----------------------|------------------------|
| nvidia/llama-3.1-nemotron-70b-instruct | 15 | 30 |
| qwen/qwen-2.5-coder-32b-instruct | 10 | 18 |
| mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct | 25 | 25 |
| mistralai/mixtral-8x22b-instruct | 100 | 100 |
| meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct | 15 | 30 |
| NousResearch/Hermes-3-Llama-3.1-8B | 10 | 10 |
| deepseek/deepseek-r1 | 300 | 300 |
| deepseek/deepseek-v3 | 100 | 100 |
| deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b | 80 | 80 |
| NaniDAO/deepseek-r1-qwen-2.5-32B-ablated | 30 | 30 |
| mistralai/mistral-small-24b-instruct | 30 | 30 |

For example, if you send a prompt of 1,000 tokens to Mixtral 8x7B and receive a 500-token response:
- Input cost: (1,000 / 1,000,000) × 25 = 0.025 credits
- Output cost: (500 / 1,000,000) × 25 = 0.0125 credits
- Total cost: 0.0375 credits

#### 4. Embedding Models
Pricing is in credits per million tokens.

| Model | Input (per 1M tokens) |
|-------|----------------------|
| baaiai/bge-large-en-v1.5 | 1 |
