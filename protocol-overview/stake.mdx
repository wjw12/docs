### HEU Staking

Staking allows HEU token holders to participate in securing the network while earning rewards. Unstaking requires a 30-day lockup period, during which the tokens cannot be transferred. This mechanism helps ensure long-term alignment between token holders and the protocol.

When you stake HEU, you receive stHEU tokens representing your staked position. The stHEU:HEU exchange rate increases over time as staking rewards accumulate, allowing you to benefit from auto-compounding returns.

### Staking Rewards

Stakers earn two types of rewards:

The base staking reward is set at 50% APR, distributed from protocol emissions. These rewards are automatically calculated and distributed.

Additionally, stakers earn dynamic rewards from protocol revenue. These rewards come from API credit purchases and vary based on network usage. As the protocol's adoption grows, the dynamic portion of staking rewards will increase proportionally with network activity.
