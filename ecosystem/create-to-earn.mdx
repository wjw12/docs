### Reward Pools

Rewards are distributed in weekly sprints. Only those with ZK token rewards >= 10 can receive rewards. You can claim your rewards at any time after the previous sprint rewards are distributed.

#### Pool 1: Minting Rewards

Pool 1 has a cap that is refreshed every sprint. Before the cap is reached, you can earn 1 ZK token from Pool 1 for every NFT you mint.

#### Pool 2: Leaderboard Rewards

* Increase your score by minting, sharing, and engaging

* Each NFT minted increases your score by 1

* Gain additional scores by sharing on X (Twitter) and uploading to Gateway Network

* Share your referral link. Both the referrer and the referee get 1 additional score for every paid mint.

* Top 40 users on the leaderboard share ZK tokens from Pool 2 at the snapshot of the end of each sprint.
