## Overview

Ask Heurist is a crypto Q&A and research agent built for traders, researchers, and crypto-natives. It delivers actionable insights across market data, social sentiment from Twitter and Telegram trading channels, and onchain data. From trending narratives to specific token analysis, Ask Heurist turns crypto noise into tradable clarity.

The platform excels at DEX tokens, including memecoins that launched an hour ago and niche assets like Zora creator coins. With access to the most up-to-date data on virtually every token, it achieves higher accuracy than general-purpose AI for crypto-specific queries.

## Key Features

### Fast Mode
Quick, straightforward answers for simple queries. Get instant responses on token prices, market caps, trending narratives, and basic project information.

### Deep Mode
Comprehensive analysis for complex research. Takes 2-3 minutes to generate in-depth reports covering market dynamics, social sentiment, onchain flows, and actionable insights.

### Versatile Coverage
- Token analysis and price action
- Project fundamentals and team research
- Trading ideas and market trends
- Crypto news and event tracking
- KOL activity and influencer sentiment

## How It Works

Ask Heurist operates through three integrated layers:

**Foundation Layer - Heurist Mesh**: Provides real-time context on crypto markets, social conversations from smart traders and high-signal influencers, and comprehensive data on every token.

**Coordination Layer - Multi-Agent Architecture**: Our proprietary system processes queries through specialized agents, combined with the reasoning capabilities of GPT-5 and Gemini 3 to generate accurate responses and research reports.

**Interface Layer**: Available on Web, Base App, Farcaster, and Telegram. Get alpha and insights wherever you are.

## Data Sources

AI is only as good as its data. Ask Heurist aggregates intelligence from:

- **Web**: Comprehensive internet coverage for news and research
- **Twitter**: Real-time social sentiment and influencer tracking
- **Telegram**: Selected trading channels for alpha signals
- **Crypto Knowledge Base**: 20,000+ projects with detailed fundamentals

- **Coingecko**: 100,000+ tokens with accurate market data
- **GMGN**: Memecoin analytics and smart trader tracking
- **Blockchain Data**: ETH, BSC, Base, and Solana onchain activity

This curated data stack makes Ask Heurist more accurate than ChatGPT for crypto-specific questions.
