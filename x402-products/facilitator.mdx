## Scale Your x402 Payments

The Heurist x402 Facilitator enables you to monetize your API or service instantly with blockchain payments. Built for developers who want to accept x402 payments without managing blockchain infrastructure.

## One-Line Integration

To accept x402 payments, here's all it takes:

```javascript
import express from "express";
import { paymentMiddleware } from "x402-express";

app.use(payTo, routes, {
  url: "https://facilitator.heurist.xyz"
})
```

That's it. Your API now accepts x402 payments from anywhere in the world.

For more detailed integration examples using Express.js, Hono, FastAPI, vanilla JavaScript and Python, see the [official website](https://facilitator.heurist.xyz/#start-building).

## Enterprise-Grade Features

- **High-Frequency Transaction Management** - Scale with confidence. Our transaction management system is built for high-frequency requests, handling thousands of payment verifications and settlements per second.

- **Multi-Chain Support** - Address a global audience. One endpoint, multiple blockchain ecosystems. Support for Base, with BNB Chain and X Layer coming soon.

- **Regulatory Compliance** - Meet regulatory requirements automatically. Our facilitator screens and blocks transactions from OFAC-sanctioned addresses, ensuring your service remains compliant without additional overhead.

- **Zero-Friction Onboarding** - Eliminate onboarding friction. Integrate in seconds with no API key needed. Payment itself acts as authentication.

- **Real-Time Observability** - Monitor every transaction in real-time. Track payment verifications, settlement status, and revenue metrics through our dashboard.

- **Automatic Token Conversion (Coming Soon)** - Accrue value without intervention. Automatically convert USDC revenue into your native project token on every settlement.

## How It Works

The facilitator handles two critical operations:

**Payment Verification**
When a client attempts to access your paid resource, the facilitator cryptographically verifies their payment signature in milliseconds. This ensures the payment is valid before you deliver the resource.

**Payment Settlement**
After verification, the facilitator submits the transaction to the blockchain, handling gas fees and confirmation. Your wallet receives the funds automatically.

## Why Use a Facilitator?

Without a facilitator, you'd need to:
- Run your own blockchain node
- Manage private keys for settlements
- Implement complex payment verification logic
- Handle gas fee management
- Monitor transaction confirmations
- Maintain OFAC compliance systems

The Heurist Facilitator handles all of this for you.
