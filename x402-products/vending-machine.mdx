## What is X402 Vending Machine?

X402 Vending Machine transforms any x402 service into an **investable primitive**. If you run an AI agent or service that generates revenue through x402 payments, you can launch a token that allows others to invest in your success.

**Key Features:**
- Launch tokens with standardized economics
- Raise capital through x402 protocol
- Enable community ownership and upside participation
- Provide trustless liquidity automatically

**The Lifecycle:** `Launch → Sell → Graduate → Trade`

Every step is verifiable on-chain. Every launch follows identical rules. No special deals or insider allocations.

## Why Does This Matter?

The agent economy generates real revenue through x402 payments. But until now, there was no way to:
- **Invest** in promising agent services
- **Raise capital** to scale your agent operations
- **Share upside** with your community
- **Create liquidity** for agent-generated value

X402 Vending Machine solves this. It's the missing infrastructure piece that converts agent usage into ownership.

## Standardized Economics

Every token launch follows identical rules. No variables. No special deals. Complete transparency.

### Token Distribution

**1 Billion Tokens (Fixed Supply)**
- **80%** (800M) → Public sale via x402
- **10%** (100M) → Liquidity pool (LP tokens burned at graduation)
- **8%** (80M) → Creator allocation
- **2%** (20M) → Platform fee

### Launch Sizes

Choose your fundraising target:

| Size | Capital Raised | Initial FDV | Token Price |
|------|---------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Small** | 4,000 USDC | 5,000 USDC | 0.000005 USDC |
| **Large** | 40,000 USDC | 50,000 USDC | 0.00005 USDC |

## Launch Lifecycle

### Phase 1: Sale Period (14 Days)

- Anyone can purchase (humans or agents) with USDC
- Tokens mint immediately to buyer wallets
- Transfers are locked (prevents pre-market trading)
- 14-day window to sell 800M tokens

### Phase 2: Graduation (Automatic)

When 800M tokens are sold, the contract automatically:

1. Swaps 100% of raised USDC → HEU on Uniswap V3
2. Creates Token/HEU liquidity pair on Uniswap V2
3. Burns LP tokens permanently
4. Enables token transfers

### Phase 3: Refund (If Unsuccessful)

If 800M tokens are not sold within 14 days:
- All buyers receive proportional USDC refunds
- Tokens are burned from user wallets
- No capital loss for participants

## Security & Trust

**What Makes This Safe?**

✅ **Immutable Contracts** - No upgrade keys or admin functions

✅ **Burned LP Tokens** - Automatic burn at graduation (rug pulls impossible)

✅ **Zero Admin Keys** - Treasury has no privileged access

✅ **Onchain Verification** - All state transitions emit events

✅ **Standardized Economics** - Every launch follows identical rules

## Vision: Sovereign Sub-Economies for Agents

Think of each token as a trading collective with its own financial system where members hold tokens and govern decisions, internal transactions use the native currency, and external purchases require other tokens. The collective operates as an economically sovereign zone, similar to how medieval city-states functioned with their own currencies and trade rules.

These economies interoperate through shared protocols, allowing agents to move freely between economies based on utility and price while capital flows to where value is created. X402 Vending Machine builds these economies. Each token launched represents ownership in an economic territory, a coordination mechanism for agents, value capture for ecosystem participants, and access to agentic value creation. It's not about creating monopoly agent economy, but enabling a Cambrian explosion of micro-economies that all interoperate through multiple blockchains.
