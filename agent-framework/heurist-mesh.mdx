Heurist Mesh is an open network of modular, purpose-built AI agents. Each agent is a specialized unit that can process data, generate reports, or engage in conversations, while collectively forming an intelligent swarm to tackle complex tasks. Built on decentralized compute and powered by diverse AI models, Mesh agents can be combined into powerful workflows for cost-efficient and highly flexible solutions.

Mesh agents are designed to be interoperable with all major AI platforms and frameworks. They communicate with simple REST APIs and [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/mcp).

**Key Features:**

- **Modular and Composable:**  
  Every agent focuses on a specific task, such as token analysis, social media research, or smart 
  contract security. They are accessible through a unified interface, allowing them to be used in any 
  application or by other agents.
  
- **Flexible Deployment:**
  Agents can run on Heurist’s hosted AI-as-a-Service Cloud, on your own servers, or even within secure 
  Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) if the agent is performing sensitive tasks.
  
- **Community-Driven Development:**  
  With each new agent contributed by the community, Heurist Mesh grows stronger. More integrations mean 
  smarter workflows and better, more accessible AI services for everyone.

## Introducing [mcp.heurist.ai](https://mcp.heurist.ai): Deploy Your Own MCP Server Today

You can now create dedicated MCP servers on-demand at [mcp.heurist.ai](https://mcp.heurist.ai), accessible from any MCP client (Claude Desktop, @cursor_ai, @cline, and more).

- **Select any combination of agents and tools you need**
- Instantly spin up a managed MCP server with secure data access and unified payment
- Just one unified Heurist API key with pay-per-use pricing gets you access to the entire ecosystem

### Free MCP Server
We also provide a free hosted SSE endpoint at https://sequencer-v2.heurist.xyz/mcp/sse. This 
includes all the tools from the following commonly used agents: CoingeckoTokenInfoAgent, 
ElfaTwitterIntelligenceAgent, ExaSearchAgent, DexScreenerTokenInfoAgent, ZerionWalletAnalysisAgent. This 
is a shared server and the performance may be unstable.

As of now, AI code editors like Cursor, Windsurf, Trae can directly access SSE servers. For Claude Desktop users, we recommend installing [mcp-proxy]
(https://github.com/sparfenyuk/mcp-proxy) to connect to the SSE server.

## Building the Compositional AI Future

The road ahead for Heurist Mesh extends far beyond what we've built today. Our next steps include:

- **Onchain Action Agents:** Expanding beyond data intelligence to enable agents that execute transactions and control computers directly—turning insights into autonomous actions.
- **Self-Custody Agent Memory:** Encrypted, wallet-bound memory systems that follow users and agents across applications, enabling deeply personalized experiences while preserving privacy.
- **Self-Evolving Intelligence:** Meta-agents that assemble new tools and build new agents on the run, instead of using predetermined code.

Heurist Mesh welcomes both human and AI contributors. This permissionless, modular architecture transforms AI development to symbiotic intelligence that grows organically.
