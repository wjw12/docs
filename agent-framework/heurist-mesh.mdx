Heurist Mesh is an open network of modular and purpose-built AI agents. Each agent is a specialized unit that can process data, generate reports, or engage in conversations, while collectively forming an intelligent swarm to tackle complex tasks. Built on decentralized compute and powered by diverse open-source AI models, Mesh agents can be combined into powerful workflows for cost-efficient and highly flexible solutions.

Mesh agents are designed to be interoperable with all major AI platforms and frameworks. They communicate with simple REST APIs and [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/mcp).

**Key Features:**

- **Modular and Composable:**  
  Every agent focuses on a specific task, such as token analysis, social media research, or smart contract security. They are accessible through a unified interface, allowing them to be used in any application or by other agents.
  
- **Flexible Deployment:**
  Agents can run on Heuristâ€™s hosted AI-as-a-Service Cloud, on your own servers, or even within secure Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) if the agent is performing sensitive tasks.
  
- **Community-Driven Development:**  
  With each new agent contributed by the community, Heurist Mesh grows stronger. More integrations mean smarter workflows and better, more accessible AI services for everyone.

**What is Model Context Protocol (MCP)?**

MCP is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to LLMs. Think of MCP like a USB-C port for AI applications. Just as USB-C provides a standardized way to connect your devices to various peripherals and accessories, MCP provides a standardized way to connect AI models to different data sources and tools.

**Available Now:** We provide a hosted SSE endpoint at https://sequencer-v2.heurist.xyz/mcp/sse. This includes all the tools from the following commonly used agents: CoingeckoTokenInfoAgent, ElfaTwitterIntelligenceAgent, ExaSearchAgent, DexScreenerTokenInfoAgent, ZerionWalletAnalysisAgent. This is a shared server and the performance may be unstable.

Cursor can directly access SSE servers. For Claude Desktop users, we recommend installing [mcp-proxy](https://github.com/sparfenyuk/mcp-proxy) to connect to the SSE server.

**In Development:** Heurist Mesh acts as a customizable and personalized MCP server provider. With an Ethereum wallet, you can select the agents and tools you want to use, and create a dedicated MCP server for your use case.
