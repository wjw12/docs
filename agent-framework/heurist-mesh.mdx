title: "Heurist Mesh"
---

Heurist Mesh is a distributed network of AI agents designed to work together like DeFi smart contracts. Each individual agent in the Mesh specializes in a particular task. All agents collaborate collectively to form an intelligent swarm capable of tackling complex tasks.

**Key Features:**

- **Modular and Composable:**  
  Every agent focuses on a specific task, such as token analysis, social media research, or smart contract security. They are accessible through a REST API, allowing them to be used in any application or by other agents.
  
- **Flexible Deployment:**
  Agents can run on Heuristâ€™s hosted AI-as-a-Service Cloud, on your own servers, or even within secure Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) if the agent is performing sensitive tasks.
  
- **Community-Driven Development:**  
  With each new agent contributed by the community, Heurist Mesh grows stronger. More integrations mean smarter workflows and better, more accessible AI services for everyone.
