Heurist Agent Framework is a lightweight and modular agent framework that allows you to build agents. Social agents are a key use case of the framework. They interact seamlessly across popular platforms such as Telegram, Discord, Twitter, Farcaster, and through REST APIs, making it simple for you to engage your audience, just like having a social media intern that works 24/7.
