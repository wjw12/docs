## What is Heurist Mesh?

Heurist Mesh is the skills marketplace for AI agents. General-purpose AI models lack specialized knowledge about Web3, and often fail to deliver accurate and relevant results. Heurist Mesh solves this by providing a marketplace of specialized AI agents that are experts in crypto analytics, ready to give your applications or agents the crypto expertise they need.

- **Composable Architecture**: Mix and match specialized agents for different tasks
- **Flexible Access**: We support REST API with API key access, x402-enabled pay-per-use API, and MCP access.
- **Curated Web3 Tools**: We curate the best Web3 tools to give your agents the best possible performance. We constantly monitor and update the tools we use to ensure they are always performant.
- **Optimized for Agents**: The input and output formats are optimized for AI agents to easily comprehend and use. Tool call rounds are reduced by 70% and token usage is reduced by 30~50% compared to simple API wrappers.
