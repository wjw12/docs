# Introduction

ComfyUI is an open-source program that allows users to use generative AI such as text-to-image, image-to-image, text-to-video and more through a flexible node-based interface. Heurist SDK abstracts away the complexity of ComfyUI, and provides simple functions in Node.js SDK to execute ComfyUI workflows on distributed GPU miners.

[SDK source code](https://github.com/heurist-network/heurist-sdk/blob/main/packages/workflow)

# Available Workflows

The SDK currently supports the following ComfyUI workflows:
- [Text to Video Generation](/dev-guide/heurist-sdk/comfyui-txt2vid) - Generate videos from text descriptions
- [Image Upscaling](/dev-guide/heurist-sdk/comfyui-upscaling) - Upscale images while maintaining quality

# Core Concepts

Each workflow in ComfyUI is represented by a `WorkflowTask`. The SDK provides a base class that handles common functionality, which specific workflow implementations extend with their unique requirements.

# Before you start

1. [Get an API key](https://heurist.ai/credits)
2. Define environment variables in `.env` file:

```
HEURIST_API_KEY=your_api_key
HEURIST_WORKFLOW_URL=https://sequencer-v2.heurist.xyz
```

# Data Structures

Each `WorkflowTask` represents a task of a specific ComfyUI workflow (identified by a JSON workflow file describing the node structures in ComfyUI). A derived class of `WorkflowTask` is defined for each individual workflow, including necessary input parameters.

## Base Class
```javascript
abstract class WorkflowTask {
  public consumer_id?: string;
  public job_id_prefix?: string;
  public timeout_seconds?: number;
  public workflow_id?: string;
  public api_key?: string;

  constructor(options: WorkflowTaskOptions) {
    this.consumer_id = options.consumer_id;
    this.job_id_prefix = options.job_id_prefix;
    this.timeout_seconds = options.timeout_seconds;
    this.workflow_id = options.workflow_id;
    this.api_key = options.api_key;
  }

  abstract get task_type(): WorkflowTaskType;
  abstract get task_details(): Record<string, any>;
}
```

## Task Option Type
```javascript
interface WorkflowTaskOptions {
  consumer_id?: string;
  job_id_prefix?: string;
  timeout_seconds?: number;
  workflow_id?: string;
  api_key?: string;
}
```

## Task Result Type
```javascript
interface WorkflowTaskResult {
  task_id: string
  status: 'waiting' | 'running' | 'finished' | 'failed' | 'canceled'
  result?: any
}
```
# Functions

## Execute a workflow
Executes a workflow task without waiting for the result.

```javascript
async executeWorkflow(task: WorkflowTask): Promise<string>
```

Returns a Promise that resolves to the task ID.

## Query the task result
Queries the result of a previously executed task.

```javascript
async queryTaskResult(task_id: string): Promise<WorkflowTaskResult>
```
Returns a Promise that resolves to the task result.

## Execute a workflow and wait for the result
Executes a workflow and waits until a result is returned. Internally, this function calls `queryTaskResult` at a fixed interval, and throws if the task times out.

```javascript
async executeWorkflowAndWaitForResult(
    task: WorkflowTask,
    timeout: number = 300000,
    interval: number = 10000
  ): Promise<WorkflowTaskResult>
```

## Cancel a task
Cancels a previously submitted task.

```javascript
async cancelTask(task_id: string): Promise<{ task_id: string; msg: string }>
```
Returns a Promise that resolves to the task ID and message.
