## Authentication

The Heurist API requires authentication using an API key. API keys are unique to your account and are used to verify your identity when making requests to the API. Keep in mind the following important points:

- **Keep your API key secure!** Your API key is sensitive information and should not be shared with others. It must never be exposed in client-side code or in any publicly accessible location (e.g., browser code, repositories).
- **Secure your key with backend services:** It’s recommended to store your API key in a secure location such as environment variables or key management services (KMS) on your backend server.

### Example Authentication Flow
To authenticate your application, you will need to pass the API key to the Heurist SDK in your server-side code. Here’s how you can set up authentication in your application:

## Usage


```typescript
import Heurist from 'heurist'

const heurist = new Heurist({
  apiKey: process.env['HEURIST_API_KEY'], 
})


async function generateImage() {
  const response = await heurist.images.generate({
    model: 'BrainDance',
    prompt: '1girl',
    // below are optional
    neg_prompt: 'worst quality',
    num_iterations: 25,
    guidance_scale: 7.5,
    width: 1024,
    height: 768,
    seed: -1
  })

  // response
  // {
  //   "url": "https://heurist-images.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/**********.png"
  //   ...
  // }
}
```
