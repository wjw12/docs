## Heurist LLM Gateway Overview

Heurist Gateway is an OpenAI-compatible LLM API endpoint designed to integrate seamlessly with open-source LLMs. It provides developers the ability to leverage decentralized AI models with the same ease as the OpenAI SDK. Simply replace the `baseURL` to get started.

For example, here's how you can use the **Heurist Gateway** with supported OpenAI SDKs in different languages.

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript Node
  import OpenAI from "openai";

  const openai = new OpenAI({
    apiKey: process.env["HEURIST_API_TOKEN"],
    baseURL: "https://llm-gateway.heurist.xyz",
  });

  const completions = await openai.chat.completions.create({
    model: "mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct",
    messages: [
      {
        role: "user",
        content: "Write rap lyrics about Ethereum",
      },
    ],
    maxTokens: 64,
    stream: true,
  });

  for await (const part of completions) {
    process.stdout.write(part.choices[0]?.delta?.content || "");
  }
  ```

  ```python Python
  from openai import OpenAI

  client = OpenAI(
      api_key="YOUR_HEURIST_API_TOKEN",
      base_url="https://llm-gateway.heurist.xyz"
  )

  completion = client.chat.completions.create(
      model="mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct",
      messages=[
          {
              "role": "user",
              "content": "Write rap lyrics about Ethereum"
          }
      ],
      max_tokens=64,
      stream=True
  )

  for chunk in completion:
      print(chunk.choices[0].delta.content or "", end="", flush=True)
  ```
</CodeGroup>


## Official OpenAI Library Support
One of the key strengths of the Heurist Gateway is its seamless compatibility with the official OpenAI libraries in any programming language. Whether you're using Python, Node.js, Ruby, or any other OpenAI-supported SDK, you can integrate the Heurist Gateway by simply replacing the baseURL in your client configuration.

For example:

- **Python**: Update the `base_url` parameter in your OpenAI client initialization from `https://llm-gateway.heurist.xyz` to OpenAI baseURL.
- **Node.js**: Set the `baseURL` in the client options during initialization.
- **Other Languages**: Refer to your language-specific OpenAI SDK and look for the endpoint or base URL configuration.

> No need to learn a new SDK! Simply continue using the official OpenAI SDK you’re already comfortable with—just update the baseURL to seamlessly connect with Heurist’s powerful decentralized AI models.
