title: "Image Generation API"
---

### Overview

Heurist provides REST API that allows developers to invoke Stable Diffusion / Flux model inference to programmatically generate images based on text prompts. This document outlines how to use the API to submit image generation jobs and retrieve the generated images.

### Authentication

To use the API, you must include a valid authentication token in the request header.

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_AUTH_KEY
```

For API Code and reference, Please visit the [Submit Job](./endpoint) section.

### Response Structure

When the job is successfully processed, the API returns a URL pointing to the generated image.

### Prompting Guide

For the best prompts, take a look at the JSON examples provided in our [Stable Diffusion examples](https://github.com/heurist-network/heurist-models/tree/main/examples). These are fully reproducible and are used in [**Heurist Imagine**](https://imagine.heurist.ai).

Each model has its strengths in terms of image style. For better results, it might take a few tries to perfect your prompts. We recommend visiting [Prompthero ](< https://prompthero.com>)and [Prompt Guide](https://stable-diffusion-art.com/prompt-guide/) to learn more about improving your prompts.

***Important:***&#x4C;oRA models require "trigger words" to activate the specific style or content. We suggest that the "autofill" field in [models.json](https://github.com/heurist-network/heurist-models/blob/main/models.json) should always be present in the prompt, and it's highly recommended to include key words in the "recommend" field.

### Cost Considerations

The cost of generating an image depends on the model type, resolution, and number of iteration steps:

* **1 Standard Unit of Credit** = 1 image generated at 1024x1024 resolution using SDXL model with 20 iterations.

* The cost of a job is proportional to the image's resolution and the number of iterations used. For example:

* If you generate an image at **1024x512** resolution using **30 iterations** with SDXL model, the cost calculation is: `1024x512 / (1024x1024) * 30 / 20 = 0.75 credits`

* **SD 1.5** models are smaller and thus cost less than SDXL models.

### Integration Examples

Want to see the Image Generation API in action? Here are a few integration examples:

* [Stable Diffusion WebUI](https://github.com/heurist-network/stable-diffusion-webui) is a simple demo project that integrates with Heurist's image generation API, built with [Gradio](https://www.gradio.app/) in Python. Here's the relevant [POST API request](https://github.com/heurist-network/stable-diffusion-webui/blob/master/main.py#L36)

* [Heurist Node.js SDK](https://github.com/heurist-network/heurist-sdk/blob/main/packages/images/index.ts) integrates with the API. The SDK provides complete authentication and error handling features.
