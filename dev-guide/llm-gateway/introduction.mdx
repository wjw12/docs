### Getting Started

To get started with the Heurist LLM Gateway, you’ll first need an API key from Heurist. Once you have your API token, integrating it into your application is as simple as a few lines of code.

Here's how you can use the **Heurist LLM Gateway** in different languages.

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript Node
  import OpenAI from "openai";

  const openai = new OpenAI({
    apiKey: process.env["HEURIST_API_TOKEN"],
    baseURL: "https://llm-gateway.heurist.xyz",
  });

  const completions = await openai.chat.completions.create({
    model: "mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct",
    messages: [
      {
        role: "user",
        content: "Write rap lyrics about Ethereum",
      },
    ],
    maxTokens: 64,
    stream: true,
  });

  for await (const part of completions) {
    process.stdout.write(part.choices[0]?.delta?.content || "");
  }
  ```

  ```python Python
  from openai import OpenAI

  client = OpenAI(
      api_key="YOUR_HEURIST_API_TOKEN",
      base_url="https://llm-gateway.heurist.xyz"
  )

  completion = client.chat.completions.create(
      model="mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct",
      messages=[
          {
              "role": "user",
              "content": "Write rap lyrics about Ethereum"
          }
      ],
      max_tokens=64,
      stream=True
  )

  for chunk in completion:
      print(chunk.choices[0].delta.content or "", end="", flush=True)
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Heurist LLM Gateway integrates seamlessly with the official OpenAI libraries. You can easily replace the `baseURL` in your client configuration to use Heurist’s decentralized models, gaining low-cost and uncensored AI capabilities. Refer to your language-specific [OpenAI SDK docs](https://platform.openai.com/docs/libraries) for endpoint configuration.
