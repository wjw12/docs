title: "Understanding Image Prompting"

Stable Diffusion can benefit significantly from the use of comma-separated words and phrases in its prompts. Using commas effectively organizes prompts into distinct elements, enhancing clarity and aiding in the generation of more relevant images. For example, a prompt structured as "a cat, a dog, a tree" allows the model to interpret each item separately, which can lead to more accurate and coherent outputs compared to a continuous paragraph of description. This practice is especially useful for creators who want to ensure that specific attributes or elements are emphasized in their generated images. 

Flux models work best if the prompt contains complete sentences depicting the image. Comma-separated tags are not recommended. This is a major difference between Stable Diffusion and Flux.

LoRA is a fine-tuning technique that makes a model learn a specific concept, style, item, or character. LoRA requires "trigger words" to function. For example, the phrase "Heuristai logo" must be included if you want the `HeuristLogo` model to generate a correct logo. Some LoRA models require multiple words or phrases to trigger effectively.
