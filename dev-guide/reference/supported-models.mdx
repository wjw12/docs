### üß† **Understanding Image Prompting**

Effective prompting is key to obtaining the best results from Heurist's image generation models. Depending on the model type, prompts should be structured differently to optimize the output.

---

#### üìù **Prompting Techniques: Stable Diffusion vs. Flux Models**

- **Stable Diffusion Models**:  
  These models work best when prompts use **comma-separated words** or **tags** to describe distinct elements. The commas act as dividers between different objects, characteristics, or styles.

  - **Example Prompt**: `"cat, dog, tree"`
  - This clear separation of elements helps the model generate accurate and cohesive images.

  - **Best Practice**: Use concise, clear keywords separated by commas to define key elements. This approach is particularly useful for artists looking to generate flexible, varied images.

- **Flux Models**:  
  Unlike Stable Diffusion, Flux models require **complete sentences** for best results. Using full descriptions rather than tags allows the model to better understand context and produce high-quality outputs.

  - **Example Prompt**: `"A friendly cat sitting under a tree with sunlight filtering through the leaves"`
  - This narrative-style prompt helps the model understand the overall scene and generate more realistic and detailed images.

  - **Best Practice**: Provide descriptive sentences that convey the full context of the image. This allows the model to focus on generating cohesive, contextually-aware content.

---

#### üîë **LoRA Models and Trigger Words**

LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) models are designed to recognize specific styles or features. These models rely on **trigger words** to generate content aligned with your desired concept.

- **What are Trigger Words?**  
  Trigger words are specific phrases that activate a particular behavior in the model. By using them, you ensure the output matches the intended style or theme.

  - **Example Trigger Word**: `"Heuristai logo"`
  - Including this phrase generates the Heurist logo.

- **Best Practices**:  
  Each LoRA model has its own set of trigger words, such as:
  - `"Pepe"` for the Pepe meme character.
  - `"magusdevon"` for the character from Forgotten Runes.
  
  To fine-tune the output, consider adding additional keywords related to the specific details of the character or style you're aiming for.

---

#### üìç **Additional Tips for Optimizing Image Prompts**

1. **Be Specific**: Instead of generic terms, describe the details clearly. E.g., use `"fluffy white cat with blue eyes"` instead of just `"cat"`.
   
2. **Provide Context**: For more dynamic or complex scenes, include context such as location or setting. E.g., `"A cat sitting on a rooftop at sunset"` gives the model more context to work with.

3. **Model-Specific Keywords**: Some models have recommended trigger words or tags that help fine-tune the results. For instance:
   - **PepeXL**: Use tags like `"pepe_frog"`, `"meme"`, and add `"cartoon"` or `"3d render"` for style specifics.
   - **MagusDevon**: Keywords like `"purple headwear"`, `"blue bob haircut"`, `"mushrooms"`, etc., help define the character's appearance.
