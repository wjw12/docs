## Introducing Heurist

Heurist is a decentralized AI-as-a-Service cloud. We aggregate compute resources from trusted DePIN partners to provide serverless AI services. Heuristâ€™s API-first infrastructure elinimates the need for developers to manage GPU machines, and enables cost-efficient, censorship-free AI integration with APIs.

### Key Offerings

- **Serverless AI-as-a-Service**: Heurist abstracts away the complexities of hardware management. Use AI through intuitive APIs and SDKs with a few lines of code, saving the hassle of managing GPU machines. We support a wide range of models: LLMs, VLMs, Embedding Models, Image & Video Generation Models, and more. Learn more about our [Supported Model List](https://docs.heurist.ai/dev-guide/supported-models).

- **Heurist Agent Framework**: Build your own AI agents that connect to Heurist services and interact with other agents. Our framework makes it easy to create agents that acquire crypto knowledge, manage social media accounts, and execute complex tasks autonomously.

- **Heurist Mesh**: An open network of specialized AI agents that work together in a composable agent swarm. Each agent is purpose-built for specific tasks - analyzing token metrics, scanning smart contracts, processing onchain data, and more. Mesh agents are instantly accessible via REST APIs and MCP (Model Context Protocol). Community developers can contribute their own specialized agents, potentially earning per-use revenue.
