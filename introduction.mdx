## Introducing Heurist

Heurist is a decentralized AI-as-a-Service cloud. We aggregate compute resources from individual GPU owners and data centers to provide serverless AI services. Heuristâ€™s API-first infrastructure elinimates the need for developers to manage GPU machines, and enables cost-efficient, censorship-free AI integration with APIs.
